				<p class="subheader"> Interview #1 - JANE DOE </p>
				<p> Jane Doe is a Computer science major minoring in Gender Women Studies, they enjoy playing JRPGs, visual novels, and narrative basd games on the Nintendo Switch and PC</p>
				<p>Jane Doe said that they check their inventory (Q1) when they want to manage their inventory. They go into more depth of whenever they feel like they've accumulated a lot of items, Jane Doe likes to open the invenotry to select an auto-sort function to organize their items if its provided by the menu. They instantly check a new item that they pick up in the inventory menu in order to inspect it, esp when it comes to items that are collectables or materials, inorder to keep track of whether of not to hold onto it or sell it.</p>
				<p>When asked about Question 2, they replied with the Strcutre of the inventory menu instantly catches their attention. They said think about how the layout of the menu conveys the interaction expected out of the player.</p>
				<p>Their next answer for (Q3) was that they tend to search for common or replenashiable consumable items when using an inventory menu. Jane Doe went on to say that depending of the economy of the game, giving an example that if eye drops are very common items they pick up, but blindness as a status effect rarely happens to them, they will barely interact with that specific consumable item and just horde them.</p>
				<p> Jane Doe replied with  liking their items conveyed in an inventory menu with some sort of visual indication and don't like a text only inventory menu. They're specified two exmaples whether theirs a list of item names in text, but a window on the side that shows the image of the item when clicked on or certain game inventory menue where the bullet point is the image sprite itself.</p>
				<p> When asked about how to organize their Inventory menu (Q5) they tend to rely on an auto-sort and sometimes they aren't happy with the results they get, but will tolerate it for time conviences.  The most important thing for them is that they want items to be categorized into group types more than anything.</p>
				<p> Jane doe said they're not interacted with as much different types of menu layout so far, but they said they've been satisifed with menus where you have all the items on one  pageand you use filters to narrow down to specific items appearing on the list, with the ability to jump between pages of items that has little to no scrolling</p>


				<p class="subheader"> Interview #2 - JOE DANE </p>
				<p> Joe Dane is an undergrad double majoring in Gender Women Studies and Sociology, he casually plays video games on the Playstation 4</p>
				<p>Joe Dane said he pulls up the inventory  when he's forgoten what the movesets are or checking the stats of weapons/items when he's trying out a new character or weapon in a shooter or fighting game.</p>
				<p>The first thing that gets his attention about inventory is how big the text is. He prefers not having to squint to see it and have the text large enough to be easily readable.</p>
				<p>When asked about what items does he mainly search for in an inventory (Q3), he said mainly new skill items and movesets in order to get the info of the description and learning how to implement them.</p>
				<p> His reply for Questions 4 was that he likes items being conveyed on an inventory menu with a mixture of images and text. He went to describe that he prefers a menue where each item has text for their name and their own image with short simple text that conveys the items information.</p>
				<p>When asked about how he prefers his items organized in an inventory menu (Q5), he said he prefers them in alphabetical order.</p>
				<p>Joe Dane said that his favorite way navigating an inventory menu (Q6) was pressing a button to the inventory screen and scrolling through a rotateing list of items</p>

						<p class="subheader"> Observation #1 - Pokemon Sword and Shield </p>
						<p><span class="caption">Source:</span> <a href="https://twitter.com/Wheelbaron/status/1223073576049238016">https://twitter.com/Wheelbaron/status/1223073576049238016</a></p>
						<p> The user starts in some sort of main menu screen, they then select the pokemon icon and the screen transports to presemably the users team of Pokemon, only 2 pokemon in the team. The user selectes the pokemon GlobGloblin and a white submenu appears on the right of the GlobGloblin icon (see Fig #1). The arrow is first pointing to "check summary" but quickly scrolls down the "Held Item" presumabily to change the held item that GlobGoblin was holding, thats displayed below its name as the word "leftovers".(check in Figure 1.)</p>

							<figcaption><span class="caption">Fig #1:</span> GlobGloblin submenu</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p> For a split moment another white submenu replaces the previous one, this time it has 4 options: Open bag, put it back to your bag, give an item, or back. The user instantly clicks on 'open back'. The screen changes to what appears to be an inventory menue with a yellow and white background. the page has text that is assumably listing each Item, each item name seems to have a number next to it wich likely implies the amount the user has in stock of that specific item. There's also a row of 11 icons displayed at the top of the screen 10 of them white, with the 1st icon in black (fig 2 and Fig 3).
						</p>
						<figure>
							<img src="Screen Shot 2020-01-30 at 11.08.58 PM.png">
							<figcaption><span class="caption">Fig #2:</span> row of item classifications</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p> Each Icon seems to indicate a type of item that your inventory items are organized under, with the icon in black as the currently selected icon. The user takes a second shift to the 5th Icon, a piece of candy, which has the text underneath it change into "other items". Once the user  takes a second to scroll down and select the 4th item, 'Exp. Candy L', an another sub-menu appear at the bottom of the menu with the text, implying that the menu is asking the user how many candies they want to use (see fig #3). The user spends no time selecting 11 candies and we see an animation that heavily implies GlobGlobilin's levels up 2 times, we get a short congratulatory sound playing and the level of GlobGloblin goes up by lv 90. </p>

							<figcaption><span class="caption">Fig #3:</span> Trainer bag menu layout</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p>This entire process took 25 seconds, even with the amount of notable submenues just to use an item of GlobGloblin. The user seems to be very familiar with this layout of this menu, since no signs of hesitation where prominant in this observation. It can be implied then that this user has done this several times.</p>

						<p class="subheader"> Observation #2 - Pathologic  (1:05:46 - 1:07:10)</p>

						<p> The user is presumably male in his late 20s early 30s. This video is heavily implied to be a recording of a live reaction of a stream since the user is talking directly to his audience and the constant updating comment secition on the right of the video. The user starts with him literally asking directly to the audiance if he can check his inventory, their tone implies confusion. While he ask's this, it can be implied that he presses the wrong key for the inventory since the player character fists pull up first for a split moment on the screen and disppaear. Then the inventory pops up on the lower screen as a menu bar (Fig #4)</p>

							<figcaption><span class="caption">Fig #4:</span> The inventory menu of Pathologic</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p> User then moves their mouse onto the first item on the menu bar you can hear a click noise for a split second, implying that the user's mouse clicked on the item. Text then hover aboves the item (Fig #5). At this point the user seems to be still hesitant about using this system because they say, "oh no-no-no" while moving the mouse off the item for a split second, causing the text box to instanlty disappear, but then moves back onto the item saying "Oh yeah, click it", when they realize that its the correct interaction.</p>

							<figcaption><span class="caption">Fig #5:</span> The item descptions in Pathologic</figcaption>
						</figure>
						<p> They then proceed to read off the text descripbing the scaple pausing for a moment after reading out the first sentence and then continueing off the next one. The next step they take is clicking on the "clothes" tab from the item menue. The user hovers the mouse icon over the Protective Glove item, instantly picking up that its conving the info of what the player character is currently playing, they affirm this by saying, "Protective gloves, gotcha!" and proceed to move the mouse ontot the next tab. </p> 
						<p>The player seems to start getting the gist of navigating this tuitorial becuase they  clck on the next inventory tab "drugs", and instinctively, move the the mouse to the first item to click on it. However instead of a text box appearing, the user accidentaly consumed the first item, since it was a consumable. They notice the sudden removal of the item from the menu list and say, "oh... I just took the drugs". </p>
						<p>The User proceed to the next item this time mvoeing the mouse icon over the Morphine itme and not clicking it this time. They read out the desciption this time, but pause on a word, either because the text is too small to read or don't know how to pronounciate the word, and skip it. The user then recognizes that these are where the health items are stored and proceed ot hover over the next 2 items reading off their health affects instead of reading all of the text or making joke. They move to the next tab "rations, move the mouse over the item, read out the item's name "water" and proceed to the click on the next tab. At this point the user has finally picked up how to naigate this window, clicking on the final item tab, "other", he is able to  identifies the first tiem as "Kerosene" in a split-second. The second item e dientifies as a "needle, and pauses, reading the text to himself and calls to attention that the item, "Needle" is valued amoung children NPC's. He hovers the mouse over the 3rd item, but gets breifly distracted by two clone NPC's that walk past him. He then reads out the item description for the "silver ring" and quickly identifes the last item in has inventory as an "empty bottle". The user finally closes the window.</p>
