				<p>Jane Doe said that they check their inventory (Q1) when they want to manage their inventory. They go into more depth of whenever they feel like they've accumulated a lot of items, Jane Doe likes to open the invenotry to select an auto-sort function to organize their items if its provided by the menu. They instantly check a new item that they pick up in the inventory menu in order to inspect it, esp when it comes to items that are collectables or materials, inorder to keep track of whether of not to hold onto it or sell it.</p>
				<p>When asked about Question 2, they replied with the Strcutre of the inventory menu instantly catches their attention. They said think about how the layout of the menu conveys the interaction expected out of the player.</p>
				<p>Their next answer for (Q3) was that they tend to search for common or replenashiable consumable items when using an inventory menu. Jane Doe went on to say that depending of the economy of the game, giving an example that if eye drops are very common items they pick up, but blindness as a status effect rarely happens to them, they will barely interact with that specific consumable item and just horde them.</p>
				<p> Jane Doe replied with  liking their items conveyed in an inventory menu with some sort of visual indication and don't like a text only inventory menu. They're specified two exmaples whether theirs a list of item names in text, but a window on the side that shows the image of the item when clicked on or certain game inventory menue where the bullet point is the image sprite itself.</p>
				<p> When asked about how to organize their Inventory menu (Q5) they tend to rely on an auto-sort and sometimes they aren't happy with the results they get, but will tolerate it for time conviences.  The most important thing for them is that they want items to be categorized into group types more than anything.</p>
				<p> Jane doe said they're not interacted with as much different types of menu layout so far, but they said they've been satisifed with menus where you have all the items on one  pageand you use filters to narrow down to specific items appearing on the list, with the ability to jump between pages of items that has little to no scrolling</p>
